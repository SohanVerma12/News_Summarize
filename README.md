What is Text Summarization?
Text summarization in NLP is the process of creating summaries from large volumes of data while maintaining significant informational elements and content value. The language of the summary should be concise and straightforward so that it conveys the meaning to the reader. As per Statista, by 2025, the total amount of data created, recorded, copied, and consumed worldwide is expected to exceed 180 zettabytes. Most of this text data needs to be minimized to more straightforward, concise summaries containing essential details to browse and analyze them more easily. There is a high demand for machine learning algorithms that can quickly summarize lengthy texts and offer accurate insights. This is precisely where text summarization comes into the picture!

Text summarization is beneficial for several NLP tasks, including text classification, legal text summaries, news summaries, generating headlines, etc. Let us further look into the key reasons behind the growing demand for Text Summarization.
